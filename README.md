# Larus Thor - NEXI Group. Senior Front-End engineer 
This is a code assignment for the position of Senior Front-End engineer at NEXI group.

## Goals
Memory pair matching game with cards.
30 cards (i.e. 15 pairs). Cards are initially hidden but during game player can click on a pair of card to reveal them.
If cards have a matching symbol they remain revealed.
If the cards do not match they are (after a short delay) flipped to hide them again.
Player wins when all symbols are matched.
A reset button to start a new game.

## Technical decisions
1. [requirement] Only use react functional components
2. [requirement] Use typescript and provide types to props, states and utility function signatures
3. No `any` types
4. [requirement] Organize the code clearly and logically
5. [requirement] Use a clean function to shuffle the cards

## Getting started
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Run development server with `npm run dev`
